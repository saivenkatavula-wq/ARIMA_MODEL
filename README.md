# ARIMA Model for Time Series Forecasting

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for time series forecasting. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to apply ARIMA to a dataset, including data preprocessing, model fitting, and forecasting future values.

## Contents

- `ARIMA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that covers the entire process of implementing the ARIMA model.
  - **Data Loading and Exploration**: Initial data loading and basic exploratory data analysis.
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and differencing.
  - **Model Selection**: Determining the optimal parameters for the ARIMA model using criteria like AIC.
  - **Model Fitting**: Fitting the ARIMA model to the training data.
  - **Forecasting**: Using the fitted model to make future predictions.
  - **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib statsmodels jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARIMA-Model.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd ARIMA-Model
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook ARIMA.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells step-by-step.

## Examples

The notebook includes detailed examples and explanations to help you understand each step of the ARIMA modeling process. The examples cover:

- Loading and visualizing a time series dataset.
- Performing necessary transformations to make the data stationary.
- Selecting appropriate ARIMA parameters using the ACF and PACF plots.
- Fitting the ARIMA model and making forecasts.
- Evaluating the model's performance and visualizing the results.
